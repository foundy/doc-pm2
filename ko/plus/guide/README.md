## Terminology

Let's first explain some terminology we will use across this guide:

A **bucket** is an entity related to PM2 Plus which is associated to a billing plan. Buckets are generally used to group and monitor multiple servers of a single project.

A **server** is a container or a machine with a PM2 daemon managing one or more processes.

A **process** is an entity of the process list (`pm2 ls`). This is one instance of an app which has been started by PM2.
