# Realtime Logs

![Logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keymetrics/branding/master/screenshots/plus/logs/logs.png)

In PM2 Plus you are able to stream the logs that your application output directly to the dashboard.
It can be really helpful if you don't want to SSH into your servers and use `pm2 logs`

Note that if you are looking for a log storage solution, you can checkout the PM2 Enterprise product which contains log retention.
