## Connect your server to the dashboard

Connect your server to your dashboard and start collecting metrics with:

```bash
pm2 link <secret> <public>
```

Or, if you don't have access to the CLI, add `PM2_PUBLIC_KEY` and `PM2_SECRET_KEY` environment variables set with your public and private keys.

Use the `connect` button on the top right of your dashboard to find your `PM2_PUBLIC_KEY` and `PM2_SECRET_KEY`
