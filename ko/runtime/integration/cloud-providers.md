# Using PM2 in a Cloud Provider

You might find yourself in a situation in which you do not have access to the CLI to start your Node.js applications.

In such a situation, pm2 must be added as a dependency and must be called with the start script.

## Prepare your app

### Set your ecosystem file

Generate an `ecosystem.config.js` template with:

```bash
pm2 init
```

Modify the ecosystem file to match your needs:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: "app",
    script: "./app.js",
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: "development",
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
    }
  }]
}
```

{: .tip}

### Add PM2 as a module

Add pm2 as a dependency to your projet.

With npm:

```bash
npm install pm2
```

With yarn:

```bash
yarn add pm2
```

### Start script in package.json

In your `package.json`, modify your `start` script like the following:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "pm2-runtime start ecosystem.config.js --env production"
  }
}
```

## Deploy your app

You can now deploy your application in your cloud providers like you would have done for a regular node.js app.

## Next Steps
