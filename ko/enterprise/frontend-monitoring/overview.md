# Frontend Monitoring overview

Start monitoring your website frontend inside your PM2 dashboard.  This will allow collecting and inspecting:

* uncaught JavaScript exceptions experienced by your users
* users unexpected behaviors (rage clicks, rage reloads...)
* bad user experiences (slow requests...)
